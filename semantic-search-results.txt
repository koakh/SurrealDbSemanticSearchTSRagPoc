-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<|20,150|>

chat response:

You can change the `releaseChannel` from "Stable" to "Dev" in the `c3-updater` configuration by running the following command:

```
npx c3-updater --config-path <path-to-your-config-file> --set-release-channel=Dev
```

Replace `<path-to-your-config-file>` with the actual path to your `c3-updater` configuration file.

Alternatively, you can edit the configuration file manually. The file is usually located at `~/.config/c3-updater/config.json`. Open the file in a text editor and update the `releaseChannel` property to `"Dev"`:

```json
{
  "releaseChannel": "Dev"
}
```

Save the changes and restart your c3-updater instance.

Note that this will change the release channel for all updates, including future ones. If you want to temporarily switch to the Dev channel without changing the default setting, you can use the `--dev-channel` flag with the update command:

```bash
npx c3-updater --dev-channel --install <package-name>
```

This will install the specified package from the Dev channel instead of the Stable channel.

The provided context does not directly mention the type of license that the freeCodeCamp codebase is released under. To find out the specific license details, you would typically refer to the LICENSE file or the project's repository on GitHub where such information is usually stated at the root level. However, if this context was extracted from a document related to freeCodeCamp's licensited codebase, one could infer it likely follows an open-source license given its nature as a collaborative coding platform. The most common open-source licenses for such platforms include MIT License, GPL (GNU General Public License), and Apache 2.0. For accurate information, please consult the freeCodeCamp project's LICENSE file on GitHub or their official documentation.

chat response:

 The best way to help with freeCodeCamp.org is by translating and improving the curriculum, codebase, documentation, and community. You can follow these steps to set up your local copy of freeCodeCamp:

1. **Installation**: 

    - Install Node.js (>=v12) on your system. If you are using macOS, this is already installed by default. 
    - Navigate to the directory where you have installed Node.js and type `node -v` to check if it's installed. If not, install with npm: `npm init -y`
    - Run `npm install` to get all dependencies.
2. **GitHub Setup**: 
    
    To set up your local copy of freeCodeCamp, follow these steps on GitHub:

    - Go to the `freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp` repository and click "Fork" next to the issue or PR you want to contribute to. This will create a new branch for you to work in.
    
3. **Cloning the Repository**: 

    Once you have your local clone of the `freeCodeCamp` repository, navigate to the directory where you cloned it and type `git remote -v`. If you don't see "origin", set up a remote for this repository: `git remote add origin <remote-url>`

4. **Installing NPM Packages**:

    Navigate to your project folder and run the following command in terminal: 

    ```bash
    npm install --registry=https://npm.freecodecamp.org/
    ```
    
    This will set up your `package.json` with all the required dependencies needed for the project.

5. **Setting Up Cypress Testing**:

    If you are working on the UI related issues and enhancements, you can start by setting up a local instance of Cypress testing. To do this, follow these steps on GitHub: 
    
    - Install Node.js (>=v12) on your system. If you are using macOS, this is already installed by default. 
    - Navigate to the directory where you have installed Node.js and type `node -v` to check if it's installed. If not, install with npm: `npm init -y`
    - Run `npm install cypress-cli` in your project folder. This will set up Cypress testing for your project.
    
6. **Running Locally**: 
    
    To run the application locally, type `cypress start` in your project folder and press Enter. You can navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser after running this command. 

7. **Committing Changes and Pushing Changes**: 

    After making any changes to the codebase or documentation, commit them locally with the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Improving XYZ feature"
    ```
    
    After committing, push your changes to the `main` branch using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

8. **Pull Requests (PR) Process**: 

    Now that you have committed your changes, open a new branch for your contribution. For example, if you are working on the `cypress` feature, create a branch named `feature-cypress`. If you need to make any updates, you can rebase this branch on the latest code and then merge it into the `main` branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-cypress
    git pull origin main
    ```
    
    After making changes in the `feature-cypress` branch, push your changes back to the `main` branch:
    
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

9. **Merging and Deploying**:

    Once you have successfully merged your contribution into the `main` branch, you can open a pull request on GitHub. This will trigger a review process where other contributors can provide feedback and merge it if they are satisfied with your changes.

10. **Follow-up**:

    After the initial merge, maintaining a collaborative environment is important to ensure smooth progress on the projects. It's also encouraged to open issues for bugs or feature requests, collaborate on design decisions, and review each other’s work. Always be ready to learn from others and make constructive feedback.

chat response:

 To set up freeCodeCamp locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: You can either use the pre-built Docker containers or install Node.js and NPM on your local machine.

2. **Clone the repository**: If using Docker containers, simply run `docker pull freecodecamp/freecodecamaproject` in the directory where you'd like to store your copy of the project. This will save you from cloning each time you want to work on a new branch.

3. **Install dependencies**: Run the following command in the root of the repository to install all dependencies: `npm install`. If you're working on a specific branch, you can also use `npm run storybook` to start Storybook for that branch.

4. **Create a new project**: To create a new project, run `npx create-react-app <project_name>`. This will give you a React application template and an example React component. You can replace the example with your own components or use the code as a starting point for your project.

5. **Create a development environment**: To set up a development environment, run `npx envinfo --system". This will show you the Node.js and npm versions in use on your system. You can install additional tools if needed to enhance your development experience.

6. **Run the app locally**: Run `npm start` from within the project directory to start a development server. This will serve the React application at http://localhost:3000. The Storybook UI will also be available at http://localhost:9000.

7. **Test your changes**: Once you're done making changes, run `npm test` to run tests. Any syntax or linting errors should be caught during this step.

8. **Make changes and commit**: Make any necessary changes and commit them to your local repository. You can use the Git commands provided in the prompts.

9. **Push the code**: Once you're ready, push the changes to your remote repository (if not already done) using `git push`. This will trigger a build process on your server.

10. **Build and deploy**: Finally, run `npm run build` from within the project directory to create a production-ready version of the application. Then, use the `npm run start` command to serve the project on http://localhost:3000. This will automatically update when you make changes in your codebase and will rebuild the project automatically.
