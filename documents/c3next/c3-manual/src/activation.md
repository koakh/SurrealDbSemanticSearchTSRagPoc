# C3 Micro-Cloud Activation

By default, your C3 Micro-Cloud already comes pre-activated and ready to be used. It should also be pre-loaded with a set of pre-defined content that is suitable to your geographical area. This way, you don't need to activate your device when you first receive it.

However, in the event that you needed to restore the C3 Micro-Cloud to its original state, then you will need to activate it again.

> If you need to restore your C3 Micro-Cloud, please send an email to <support@critical-links.com> stating that you are restoring your C3 and that you need your License Key deactivated. Your C3 won't accept your License Key unless you do this step**

#### When accessing a C3 Micro-Cloud that has been restored to it's initial state, you will be greeted on the first time that you access the initial interface with an activation Wizard

## Step 1: Start

The Activation Wizard is comprised of 4 or 5 steps, depending on if you have a WiFi enabled C3 Micro-Cloud or note.

The first step will provide you with basic information about the Wizard and where you might physically find the location of the License ID.

## Step 2: Test internet access

In this step, the C3 Micro-Cloud will perform three different tests to make sure that you can continue with the device activation.

If any of the tests fail, they will state so. In the case of an invalid IP address, you will have the opportunity to correct it by either connecting the device to a valid network or by configuring the WAN settings by clicking on the "Change internet settings" button.

> In the case that the Licensing Server is not reachable, you should an email to <support@critical-links.com> with your License ID and the indication that you are unable to reach the Licensing server.

## Step 3: Select Timezone

This step will allow you to assign a timezone to your C3 Micro-Cloud. It's very important that you assign the correct timezone since this is not an operation that is allowed after the device is activated. This step will ensure that date and time appear correctly according to the location of your device.

## Step 4: WiFi Regulatory Domain (For WiFi enabled devices)

Like Timezone, selecting your country correctly here, will ensure that WiFi operation parameters are ideal to your location. In here, you should select the country where this unit will be operating.

## Step 5: Insert License Key

In this final step, all that is left is inserting the License Key. After this operation is successfully performed, your device will be fully activated and ready to be used.

You can now start using your device and take advantage of all its possibilities.
